# Dichotomizer

Assume that the prior probabilities for the first two categories are equal (𝑃𝑃(𝜔𝜔1) = 𝑃𝑃(𝜔𝜔2) = 1/2
and 𝑃𝑃(𝜔𝜔3) = 0) and design dichotomizer for those two categories using only the 𝑥𝑥1 feature 
value

Determine the empirical training error on your samples, that is the percentage of points 
misclassified.
